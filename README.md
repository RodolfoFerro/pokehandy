# ‚ö°Ô∏è Pok√©handy ‚Äì Pok√©mon Hand Simulator [WIP üöß]

This application aims to simulate the hand of a Pok√©mon TCG player. 
We want to help Pok√©mon TCG players to understand the distribution of cards 
of their decks and to simulate starting hands + prizes + mulligans.

This is a work in progress and I'm currently streaming the development of
this tool every friday at 9 PM (üá≤üáΩ) on 
[https://twitch.tv/fractalfox_](https://twitch.tv/fractalfox_).

## To do list:

- [X] Convert deck fortmat from PCTGO to a processable list of information
- [X] Search card info through the [Pok√©mon TCG API](https://pokemontcg.io/)
- [ ] Display cards (deck) in a grid
- [ ] Build an object with card info from the API
- [ ] Build a virtual deck
- [ ] Build shuffling algorith (Fisher-Yates or similar)
- [ ] Simulate hands + mulligans + prizes
- [ ] Build useful visualizations
